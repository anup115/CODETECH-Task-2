**DESCRIPTION**

Developing a Python program to track and manage student grades involves creating a system that allows users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculates the average grade, and displays the overall performance with additional information such as letter grades or GPA. Here's a step-by-step description of the key components and functionalities required for this program:

**Step-by-Step Description:**

**1.User Input for Grades:**

The program should prompt the user to input grades for different subjects or assignments. This can be done using a loop that continues to ask for grades until the user decides to stop. Each grade can be stored in a list or a dictionary, with subjects as keys and grades as values.

**2.Calculating the Average Grade:**

Once all grades are entered, the program should calculate the average grade. This involves summing all the grades and dividing by the number of entries. The calculation should handle different types of numeric input (integers and floats).

**3.Determining Additional Information:**

The program should convert the average grade into additional performance metrics such as a letter grade or GPA. A common scale can be used, such as:
A: 90-100
B: 80-89
C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: Below 60
GPA can be calculated based on a 4.0 scale, where A is 4.0, B is 3.0, and so on.

**4.Displaying the Results:**

The program should output the average grade, letter grade, and GPA in a clear and informative manner. It should present this information in a way that is easy for the user to understand.

**5.Error Handling and Validation:**

The program should include error handling to manage invalid inputs, such as non-numeric grades or grades out of range. It should provide appropriate feedback to guide the user in entering valid data.

**Conclusion:**
This Python program provides a comprehensive solution for tracking and managing student grades. By allowing users to input grades for various subjects, calculating the average, and displaying additional performance metrics, it helps users easily monitor academic progress. The inclusion of error handling ensures robust and user-friendly interaction, making the program practical for real-world use.
